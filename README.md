## âœ¨ Animated Icons for Android âœ¨

### Context
Here is an exploration of three techniques to build Animated Vector Icon in your Compose UI Android app:
- ðŸ‘· Building vectors by hand using `VectorPainter`
- ðŸŽ¨ Using [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) + Animated Assets
- ðŸ˜Ž Using [Rive](https://rive.app/) + Animating your own Assets

I walk through each of these approaches in the corresponding [video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDWh21h1w3QRnF8v018xPj4t3pxSZE_E) I made, so take a look!

### Code
There are two main directories:
- '/examples' : has an example of each approach
- '/components' : has some components built with each approach with runnable previews

### Resources
- ðŸ‘‘ [Lordicon](https://lordicon.com/) - for amazing animated icons
